Below is the bill of materials and manufacturing estimates for the new downscaled SMILE prototype.

# 3D print BOM

This assumes a £20 per kg PLA filament cost and £25 per kg TPU filament cost.

The costs are calculated from the filament weight including supports, the speeds for an ender 3 (entry level consumer 3D printer) and bambu x1c (high end consumer 3D printer) are given

| - Upper Right    | 26.31g PLA, Ender 3: 4h27m / Bambu X1C: 2h7m      | 0.53     |
| - Upper Top      | 40g PLA, Ender 3: 7h52m / Bambu X1C: 3h11m        | 0.80     |
| - Upper Bottom   | 30g PLA, Ender 3: 4h58m / Bambu X1C: 2h12m        | 0.60     |
| - Upper Center   | 139g PLA, Ender 3: 14h4m / Bambu X1C: 10h2m       | 2.78     |
| **Carousel**     | Group of 2 PLA parts                              | 8.82     |
| - Lower Half     | 58.16g PLA, Ender 3: 4h40m / Bambu X1C: 1h30m     | 1.16     |
| - Top Half       | 383g PLA, Ender 3: 1d18h23m / Bambu X1C: 14h21m   | 7.66     |
| Icepack Door     | 52g PLA, Ender 3: 2h53m / Bambu X1C: 1h48m        | 1.04     |
| Vaccine Door     | 77g PLA, Ender 3: 4h32m / Bambu X1C: 2h           | 1.54     |
| 12 x TPU Bumper   |12 x 12.6g TPU total, Ender 3: 2h5m / Bambu X1C: 1h    | 3.84     |
| **Total**        |                                                   | **27.56**|

## Print speeds
This gives a print time of 3 and a half days per carousel with a Bambu x1c, 6 days 1 hr 49 min for ender 3.

Assuming the printer is running for half a year continously, splitting the £1000 cost of a bambu x1c, this adds a  **£10 3D printer cost**

# Total cost : £65
Including the cost of the 3d printer, the gives a cost per prototype icebox of around. The major concern with manufacture will be with quality and the low speed of 3D printers.
