# Design Review
Before commencing with the project a design review of the existing project was performed.

We knew that our overarching goals for the project would be to enable low cost manufacture, lightweighting and downscaling, and maintaining the existing performance.

The current icebox design already works very well, and we are not in the business of redefining the concept of the smile icebox, so the overall hexagonal shape, the vaccine carousel, self closing door and central icebox concept will remain the same.

However looking at existing design there are a few features that could be improved, and there is clearly a need to adapt the existing design to a new manufacturing method.
