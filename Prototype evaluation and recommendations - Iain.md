# Prototype evaluation

Both prototypes are based off the same overall concept outlined in [Design review and initial concept](). Although the second prototype is iterated off the first prototype and it is built off the lessons from the first prototype to explore more of the design space, each prototype has their own strengths and weaknesses. 


# Prototype 1
This first prototype was largely successful in being a proof of concept and demonstrated the feasibility of 3d printing the SMILE icebox.

## Good aspects:

### Overall concept:
The overall concept of filling a thin 3D print with expanding foam is very effective, quick to implement and does add a lot of stiffness and strength to the part.

### Rivet joining method:
Rivets do an excellent job of pulling the part together and holding it together, even if the part is slightly misshapen. 

In addition the rivets are very easy to inspect, very quick to install and can be used in conjuction with other bonding methods like gluing.

### Reinforcing plate:
The reinforcement plate which is riveted on between the outer shell and the inner cylinderical part of the icebox shell does an excellent job of stiffening the part as well as ensuring the part remains the correct shape. Having this part as a seperate piece helps overcome issues with overhangs, while the laser cut manufacturing method allows this plate to span over multiple 3d printed parts ensuring they are all aligned accurately. 



### Carousel design:
The carousel design works very well with the two halves threaded on to each other. It spins freely within the part but can be disassembled easily while providing somewhat of a seal.
