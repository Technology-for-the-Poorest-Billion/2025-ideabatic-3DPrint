# Oliver Griffiths Technical Report
Author: Oliver Griffiths
This project has considered a range of technical areas. This report gives a brief overview of some of these aspects, looking at the key considerations made when selecting a suitable drone and the thermal and destruction testing of our initial prototype. The work will be summarised, and the key takeaways presented, serving as a basis for further development of this project. 

Where appropriate, links will be provided to other pages containing more detail. 

## Drone Performance and Regulation considerations:
One of the main objectives of this project is to develop a suitable vaccine cooler that could be delieverd on foot or by drone. Ideabatic were keen to explore this avenue. As dronesare becoming bigger, flying further and falling in price, they are becoming better positioned for this use. There are many aspects beyond technical design to enable these drone deliveries, with regulation being a big factor that will need to be explored further if this work develops.

Having experience developing a large drone for offshore windturbing inspections, I was well placed to lead this research with a good understanding of the currently available technology. After speaking with kitty, I developed a good understanding of a typical vaccine delivery journey and the limitations of current infrastructure. 

These vaccines are typically driven to a location as a close to the final location as possible, before being hiked for several hours to their final destination.  As such, the opportunity to use a drone that was small enough to fit in the bed of a truck seemed ideal, especially as these larger drones could carry a payload of the size needed. Kitty felt that the current solution carrying 500 doses was excessive, relaxing the constraint on the number of vaccines that needed to be carried. There are several things to note here: Driving the majority of the journey massively relaxes the range requirement of the drone, and the nature of delivery with drones meant that multiple vaccine deliveries could be easily made at little marginal cost, meaning the number of vaccines taken by the drone could be reduced.

With an idea of the kind of solution that could be made and the size of drone that would be used, we began researching possible drones that could be used to inform our decisions on the design of the cooler. Immediately we were lead to ISS aerospace, and their Sensus M aircraft. The specs are as follows: 

> Max Flight time (No Payload): 45 minutes

> Max Flight time (5kg Payload): 25 minutes

> Range: 67.5km

From this information alone, we were able to make an informed decision of a rough weight of the payload, aiming to keep it below 2.5kg and have a flight time above 30 minutes, and range of 30km (round trip). With ISS aerospace based in the UK, they seemed like a good option to aid in the development of the payload. 

After getting in touch, they kindly arranged for us to meet with one of their engineers to further discuss the project. The interview was filled with great information and advice, and has been documented in the wiki: https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2025-ideabatic-3DPrint/wiki/Drone-Sizing-,-constraints-and-regulation. 

To summarise, they felt their drone was a suitable choice and that our prototype cooler would work well with their drone. They spent a long time informing us of regulation and using the drone, and the snags we could expect to meet. Their largest concern was the nature of the operation being BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight). Whilst they didnt comment on any specific regions, they had operated in rural Africa before and stated that regulation often wasn't in place, or was only partially in place for BVLOS. However, they had stated they had been granted special clearance before, and felt the nature of our use could be granted similar special permissions to operate in these remote regions. 

They were also wary of landing the drone for a number of reasons. These are listed fully in the link above, but they felt there may be issues with landing and safely removing the coolbox, but there are ways to easily address these problems. They felt our current solution of strapping the payload onto the bottom of the drone was suitable, with it being intuitive and secure. A more complex arrangement could be made, but both we and them felt this would be unnecessary. It is important regulations and operating processes for areas where smile would deploy this solution are looked at more closely, to ensure the operation is both safe and legal.

Finally, the cost of the drone with everything needed to fly would cost around Â£30 000. Next steps should do a deeper analysis into the cost of using the drone versus traditional means, to understand if there are any cost savings in the long run. I believe if ideabatic wants to implement a larger scale operation for delivering vaccines, then drones offer the best choice and should be pursued. However, no significant analysis of the associated costs has been completed. 

Unfortunately, we were not able to conduct a test flight with our final prototype, but ISS aerospace said they would be happy to do a demonstration flight. Kitty intends to do this with ISS over the summer, and something our group hopes to be a part of. 

For anyone continuing this work, I would strongly recommend ISS aerospace as a partner, who have been very generous with their advice.
