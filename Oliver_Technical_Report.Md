# Oliver Griffiths Technical Report
Author: Oliver Griffiths
This project has considered a range of technical areas. This report gives a brief overview of some of these aspects, looking at the key considerations made when selecting a suitable drone and the thermal and destruction testing of our initial prototype. The work will be summarised, and the key takeaways presented, serving as a basis for further development of this project. 

Where appropriate, links will be provided to other pages containing more detail. 

## Drone Performance and Regulation considerations:
One of the main objectives of this project is to develop a suitable vaccine cooler that could be delieverd on foot or by drone. Ideabatic were keen to explore this avenue. As dronesare becoming bigger, flying further and falling in price, they are becoming better positioned for this use. There are many aspects beyond technical design to enable these drone deliveries, with regulation being a big factor that will need to be explored further if this work develops.

Having experience developing a large drone for offshore windturbing inspections, I was well placed to lead this research with a good understanding of the currently available technology. After speaking with kitty, I developed a good understanding of a typical vaccine delivery journey and the limitations of current infrastructure. 

These vaccines are typically driven to a location as a close to the final location as possible, before being hiked for several hours to their final destination.  As such, the opportunity to use a drone that was small enough to fit in the bed of a truck seemed ideal, especially as these larger drones could carry a payload of the size needed. Kitty felt that the current solution carrying 500 doses was excessive, relaxing the constraint on the number of vaccines that needed to be carried. There are several things to note here: Driving the majority of the journey massively relaxes the range requirement of the drone, and the nature of delivery with drones meant that multiple vaccine deliveries could be easily made at little marginal cost, meaning the number of vaccines taken by the drone could be reduced.

With an idea of the kind of solution that could be made and the size of drone that would be used, we began researching possible drones that could be used to inform our decisions on the design of the cooler. Immediately we were lead to ISS aerospace, and their Sensus M aircraft. The specs are as follows: 

> Max Flight time (No Payload): 45 minutes

> Max Flight time (5kg Payload): 25 minutes

> Range: 67.5km

From this information alone, we were able to make an informed decision of a rough weight of the payload, aiming to keep it below 2.5kg and have a flight time above 30 minutes, and range of 30km (round trip). With ISS aerospace based in the UK, they seemed like a good option to aid in the development of the payload. 

After getting in touch, they kindly arranged for us to meet with one of their engineers to further discuss the project. The interview was filled with great information and advice, and has been documented in the wiki: https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2025-ideabatic-3DPrint/wiki/Drone-Sizing-,-constraints-and-regulation
