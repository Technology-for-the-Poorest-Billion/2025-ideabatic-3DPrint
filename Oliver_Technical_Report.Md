# Oliver Griffiths Technical Report
Author: Oliver Griffiths
This project has considered a range of technical areas. This report gives a brief overview of some of these aspects, looking at the considerations made when selecting a suitable drone and the thermal and destruction testing of our initial prototype. Each will be summarised, and the key takeaways presented, serving as a basis for further development of this project. 

Where appropriate, links will be provided to other pages containing more detail. 

## Drone Performance and Regulation considerations:
One of the main objectives of this project is to develop a suitable vaccine cooler that could be delieverd on foot or by drone. Ideabatic had begun this process, and Kitty was keen to pursue this route, with drones becoming bigger, flying further and falling in price. There are many aspects beyond technical dseign to enable these drone deliveries, with the payload being a relatively small albeit critical factor. 

Having experience developing a large drone for offshore windturbing inspections, I was well placed to lead this research with a good understanding of the currently available technology. After speaking with kitty, I developed a good understanding of a typical journey and the limitations of current infrastructure. 

These vaccines are typically driven to a location as a close to the final location as possible, before being hiked for several hours to their final destination.  As such, I saw the opportunity to use a drone that was small enough to fit in the bed of a truck, but large enough to carry a significant payload with good range. Kitty felt that the current solution carrying 500 doses was excessive, relaxing the constraint on the number of vaccines that needed to be carried. There are several things to note here: Driving the majority of the journey massively relaxes the range requirement of the drone, and the nature of delivery with drones meant that multiple vaccine deliveries could be easily made at little marginal cost, meaning the number of vaccines taken by the drone could be reduced.

With an idea of the kind of solution that could be made and the size of drone that would be used, we began researching possible drones that could be used to inform our decisions on the design of the cooler. Immediately we were lead to ISS aerospace, and their Sensus M aircraft. The specs are as follows:
