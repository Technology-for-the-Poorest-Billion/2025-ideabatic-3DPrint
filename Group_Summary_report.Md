# Project Strategy

This project brought together many considerations concerning thermal performance and the use of 3D printing for manufacture, all underpinned by the payload requirements of a selected drone. These factors are closely intertwinned and the project ambitious; this called for effective communication, collaboration and pervasive planning to achieve the outcome we desired. Throughout, we communicated our main ideas and design decisions to Kitty at Ideabatic, to ensure our work culminated in what Ideabatic needed.

Our initial idea was concieved between Oliver, Iain and Hussain during the initial conferance showcasing all available projects. The three of us felt strongly about the use of 3D printing for manufacturing kittys product, and agreed delivery with drones was a compelling idea. This set a clear precident for the project, and we immediately met to discuss our induvidial strengths, weaknesses and aims. Following this, we developed a roadmap for the key deliverables and what we wanted to achieve by the close of the project.

Each team members strengths, weaknesses and aims were summarised:
Oliver has experience with mechanical design and building drones, as well as practical 3D printing knowledge. He has experience programming, but wants to develop those skills and his understanding of GIT for product development. 
Iain is excellent with CAD, and has great knowledge of procurement within the department through his time spent with the formula student team. He wants to develop his understanding of the constraints of 3D printing and how these are best mitigated.
Hussain has good understanding of heat transfer, taking both thermodynamics modules. 

With a good understanding of each others skills and aims, we laid out our ambitions of a complete, working example of a 3D printed vaccine cooler suitable for use with a drone of our choosing. 

To achieve this ambitous goal, a strict plan was set out using a Gantt Chart detailing the timeline of key technical developments, decisions and when manufacturing would have to begin. We communicated through a whatsapp group, and made full use of the GIT hub wiki and markdown files to record our research, development and the key lessons learnt. In hindsight however, the thermal test of our initial prototype should have been better planned, with access to the required equipment proving difficult and requiring some ingenuity. Time should have also been allocated to consider test and failed prints, with hardwork and effective troubleshooting required to develop our initial prototype in time for the interim presentation.
