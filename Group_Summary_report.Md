# Project Strategy

This project brought together many considerations concerning thermal performance and the use of 3D printing for manufacture, all underpinned by the payload requirements of a selected drone. These factors are closely intertwinned and the project ambitious; this called for effective communication, collaboration and pervasive planning to achieve the outcome we desired. Throughout, we communicated our main ideas and design decisions to Kitty at Ideabatic, to ensure our work culminated in what Ideabatic needed.

Our initial idea was concieved between Oliver, Iain and Hussain during the initial conferance showcasing all available projects. The three of us felt strongly about the use of 3D printing for manufacturing kittys product, and agreed delivery with drones was a compelling idea. This set a clear precident for the project, and we immediately met to discuss our induvidial strengths, weaknesses and aims. Following this, we developed a roadmap for the key deliverables and what we wanted to achieve by the close of the project.

Each team members strengths, weaknesses and aims were summarised:
Oliver has experience with mechanical design and building drones, as well as practical 3D printing knowledge. He has experience programming, but wants to develop those skills and his understanding of GIT for product development. 
Iain is excellent with CAD, and has great knowledge of procurement within the department through his time spent with the formula student team. He wants to develop his understanding of the constraints of 3D printing and how these are best mitigated.
Hussain has good understanding of heat transfer, taking both thermodynamics modules. 

With a good understanding of each others skills and aims, we laid out our ambitions of a complete, working example of a 3D printed vaccine cooler suitable for use with a drone of our choosing. 

To achieve this ambitous goal, a strict plan was set out using a Gantt Chart detailing the timeline of key technical developments, decisions and when manufacturing would have to begin. The plan played to each team members strengths, but also allowed each member to develop and meet their aims of the project. We communicated through a whatsapp group, and made full use of the GIT hub wiki and markdown files to record our research, development and the key lessons learnt. 

Hussain developed the thermal model, using content taught in the heat transfer module to inform the simulation. This tool enabled us to investigate different parameters and weights of payload to make an informed decision with regards to available drones. 

Iain focused on developing the Bulk of the CAD design, investigating ways to downsize the cooler while retaining the many features that make SMILE an effective solution. 

Oliver focused on researching available drones, and any necessary considerations that present themseleves for that use case. He also operated between Hussain and Iain on both the thermal model and CAD, helping bridge all these considerations and bring together the final prototype.

We played to each others strengths well, and were able to learn and develop from each other.

Not everything went smoothly, and in hindsight, the thermal test of our initial prototype should have been better planned, with access to the required equipment proving difficult and requiring some ingenuity. Time should have also been allocated to consider test and failed prints, with hardwork and effective troubleshooting required to develop our initial prototype in time for the interim presentation.  

For the CAD development, we opted to use OnShape - a browser based software that allowed our team to easily share and collaborate on the design. This was very effective, and allowed us to start collaborative CAD development immediately. 

Each team member spent some time becoming familiar with GIT, and this proved very beneficial to our team working abilitiy. In a manner similar to onshape, we were able to quickly develop code, with Oliver and Husaain developing their thermal simulation remotely.The repositry was also incredibly useful as a central hub for all our documentation, and we hope it will become a rich resource for Ideabatic as they continue to develop SMILE.

The technical overview is broken up into three sections

## Background
Ideabatic has developed the SMILE icebox for transporting vaccines to remote locations shown below in the image

This icebox provides significant usability and performance benefits over existing iceboxes, with a vaccine cool life of over 4 days whereas conventional vaccine iceboxes through a combination of poor usage and design. However currently these iceboxes are CNC machined, which is very costly and not scalable.

### Design brief
As such the following design brief was given to help Ideabatic further develop the SMILE icebox. With the four areas highlighted specifically mentioned in the technical summary.

In addition to these design considerations, after discussions with Kitty at Ideabatic, drone transportation of the SMILE icebox was also identified as a major opportunity, so lightweighting and downsizing the icebox is a priority.

## Technical summary
The technical summary focuses on the four areas highlighted in the design brief. The goal of low cost manufacture of the SMILE icebox was found to be completely feasible with significant process towards this aim made in the 4 weeks. 
### 1: Manufactured protoypes
Surpassing the design brief requirements to explore low cost manufacturing of the icebox hex case and carousel, two full function prototypes of the SMILE icebox were developed.

These prototypes are built off a general concept [link to initial concepts] of a thin 3d printed shell stiffened and insulated with expanding foam. Unlike the current SMILE design, it is based on a 1L icepack bottle and only has 10 vaccine compartments as opposed to 19. Despite this the later prototype has preserved all of the features present in the large scale SMILE, featuring a self closing door, a vaccine carousel and various sealing and gasket features albeit designed with a focus on manufacture via 3D printing.
