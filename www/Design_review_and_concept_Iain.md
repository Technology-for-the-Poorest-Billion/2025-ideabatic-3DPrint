# Design Review
Before commencing with the project a design review of the existing project was performed.

We knew that our overarching goals for the project would be to enable low cost manufacture, lightweighting and downscaling, and maintaining the existing performance.

The current icebox design already works very well, and we are not in the business of redefining the concept of the smile icebox, so the overall hexagonal shape, the vaccine carousel, self closing door and central icebox concept will remain the same.

However looking at existing design there are a few features that could be improved, and there is clearly a need to adapt the existing design to a new manufacturing method.

## Design concepts
A number of design concepts were envisaged to enable low cost manufacture and lightweighting of the existing icebox

### Composite manufacture
One pathways to take the project would be focusing on manufacture of the outer shells. The issue currently faced is that injection moulding of large plastic parts is very cost prohibitive. Given the small scales expected around 2000 units it may be cost effective to pursue composite manufacture of the large icebox shells.

This is because composite moulds and tooling can relatively inexpensive produced using manufacturing methods like 3D printing or machining out of wood, and the actual composite manfuacture especially if using chopped glass fibres spray on resins is relatively inexpensive.

Despite the promise of this approach it was decided it was likely infeasible within the short timeframe, and even so would limit the scope of the project towareds only manufacturing one or two parts for the icebox.

### Rigid foam concept
The idea of the the icebox is to insulate vaccines with foam. There is no actual need for a plastic shell if the foam is strong enough. However, there are many rigid foams such as extruded polypropelyene and extruded polystyrene which have the necessary stiffness and strength properties even without a strengthening shell. So a icebox could be designed to be made of foam, with the features included via 3D pinrted inserts.

However this approach is very risky and would also likely be infeasible within the short timeframe

### Expanding foam and 3D print concept
The chosen concept is to make the icebox completely from 3D printing, stiffening and insulating it using expanding foam. This leverages existing team experience wiith 3D printing and the existing resources within the dyson centre allowing for a greater scope of project. 

3D prints would need to be made in multiple pieces and joined together due to the limitations of 3D printer size.

This is an initial exploration of ideas, including a test on how to join 3D prints together. After this CAD work on a full prototype began.
