1. Introduction: Addressing the Cold Chain Challenge
The overarching challenge addressed by our "Technology for the Poorest Billion" project is the critical need for reliable and effective cold chain solutions in environments with limited infrastructure. Specifically, the cooler design, dubbed the "Smile," aims not only to keep vaccines cool but also to ensure their safe transport over long distances and arduous journeys.

A significant problem with previous approaches or existing models often lies in aspects of human error, such as the frequent opening of vaccine containers at various locations, leading to exposure to ambient air. This exposure causes rapid heating and a loss of vaccine potency, rendering them ineffective. The Smile cooler design incorporates an internal carousel mechanism. This carousel allows the vaccine container to be rotated without fully opening the main cooler, thereby preventing vaccine bottles from getting mixed up and, more importantly, drastically reducing exposure to external temperatures.

The critical temperature range for the vaccines is between 2 
∘
 C and 8 
∘
 C. Any deviation below or above this range can lead to the degradation or "death" of the vaccines, making precise temperature maintenance paramount.

This cooler is specifically targeted for use in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the precise climatic conditions vary across the region, I understand that it generally involves high ambient temperatures and potentially high humidity. The journeys are often physically demanding, involving travel across challenging terrains such as rivers and mountains, long walks on dangerous roads, and transport on the backs of trucks. These conditions can cause significant vibration. To counteract this, the carousel inside the Smile cooler is tipped with rubber, effectively absorbing shocks and energy, thus preventing damage to the vaccine bottles.

My specific contribution to this project has been the development and refinement of a thermal simulation model. This model is a crucial tool for predicting the cooler's thermal performance and optimising its insulation design to meet the rigorous demands of vaccine transportation and storage in these challenging, off-grid environments. This report will detail the technical aspects of the thermal model, its capabilities, how it informs design decisions, and avenues for future development.

2. Technical Presentation of the Solution (Handover Notes for Partner: Ideabatic)
The thermal model is designed to simulate heat transfer through a multi-layered cylindrical cooler. Its primary purpose is to accurately predict the rate of heat ingress (heat loss from the environment into the cooler) and, consequently, the duration for which a given mass of ice can maintain the cooler's internal temperature at approximately 0 
∘
 C (the ice melt temperature). This capability enables rapid virtual prototyping, reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes, allows for performance prediction under various environmental conditions, and aids in informed material and dimension selection, which are all critical for efficient development.

The model primarily considers two fundamental modes of heat transfer:

Conduction: Heat transfer through solid insulation layers, calculated using thermal conductivity.

Natural Convection: Heat transfer across the internal air gap and from the external surface to the ambient air.

The analysis employs the Ohm's Law Analogy for heat transfer, where heat flow (Q 
dot
​
 ) is proportional to the temperature difference (ΔT) divided by the total thermal resistance (R 
th
​
 ). This is expressed as:

Model Components and Calculations:

Radial Heat Transfer (Cylindrical Sides):

The model accounts for heat flow through the side walls of the cooler using the Rth_radial function. This function applies the standard formula for thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell:

R 
th,radial
​
 = 
2πLk
ln(r 
2
​
 /r 
1
​
 )
​
 
where r 
1
​
  is the inner radius, r 
2
​
  is the outer radius, L is the length, and k is the thermal conductivity of the material.

The layers included radially are:

Inner Insulation Layer: Located immediately outside the ice container. Its thermal conductivity (k 
insulation, inner
​
 ) was set to 0.03 W/mK.

Air Gap: Modelled as a convective resistance. The natural convection coefficient (h_{\text{air_gap}}) for this gap was set to 3.0 W/m 
2
 K.

Outer Foam Layer: The outermost insulation layer. Its thermal conductivity (k 
foam, outer
​
 ) was set to 0.03 W/mK.

External convection from the cooler's outer surface to the ambient air is also included, using an empirical relationship based on external air speed (as referenced in the code comments).

Planar Heat Transfer (Top and Bottom):

Heat flow through the flat top and bottom surfaces is calculated using the Rth_linear function. This function applies the standard formula for thermal resistance through a flat slab:

R 
th,linear
​
 = 
A⋅k
t
​
 
where t is the thickness, A is the area, and k is the thermal conductivity of the material.

The layers included linearly (for both top and bottom) are:

Flat Inner Insulation: This layer has the same thermal conductivity as the radial inner insulation (k_{\text{flat, insulation, top_bottom}}) was set to 0.03 W/mK.

Flat Outer Foam: This layer has the same thermal conductivity as the radial outer foam (k_{\text{flat, foam, top_bottom}}) was set to 0.03 W/mK.

Phase Change Calculation: The total heat ingress calculated from both radial and planar heat transfer is used to determine how long the ice will last. By dividing the total energy required to melt the ice (mass of ice multiplied by its specific latent heat of fusion) by the total rate of heat ingress, the model estimates the time until all the ice melts.

Boundary Temperature Calculations: The model also predicts temperatures at the interfaces between different insulation layers. This is crucial for vaccine safety, particularly to ensure that the temperature at the vaccine container interface remains within the 2 
∘
 C−8 
∘
 C range, preventing freezing whilst optimising cooling duration.

Baseline Model Parameters:

Our initial "baseline" cooler design, from which subsequent iterations stemmed, had the following characteristics:

Mass of ice (m 
ice
​
 ): 2.5 kg

Length of cylindrical container (L 
container
​
 ): 0.2 m

Thickness of the outer foam (t 
foam, outer
​
 ): 0.08 m

Thickness for the flat inner insulation (t_{\text{flat, insulation, top_bottom}}): 0.005 m (Assumed to be the same as radial inner insulation thickness).

Thickness for the flat outer foam (t_{\text{flat, foam, top_bottom}}): 0.05 m.

Specific Latent Heat of Fusion for ice (SLH 
ice
​
 ): 334000 J/kg (standard value)

​
 ): 30 
∘
 C (standard test condition)

Ice Temperature (T 
ice, temp
​
 ): 0 
∘
 C (assumed constant for melting ice)

External Air Speed (v 
external, air
​
 ): 1.0 m/s (standard test condition)

Key Assumptions and Simplifications:

Steady-State Heat Transfer: The model assumes constant temperatures over time, focusing on the equilibrium heat flow into the cooler.

Ignoring Radiation: Heat transfer by radiation between surfaces or to the environment is not explicitly included in this iteration of the model.

Ignoring Plastic Conduction: The thermal contribution of the plastic casing materials is considered negligible compared to the insulation layers.

Uniform Material Properties: Material thermal conductivities and convection coefficients are assumed to be constant within their respective layers.

Simplified Geometry for Flat Sections: The flat top and bottom areas are approximated using the inner ice container's cross-sectional area.

Empirical Convection Correlations: The model relies on estimated or empirical convection coefficients, particularly for external airflow, which may have specific validity ranges.

3. Description of Data/Code/Blueprints Available in the Repository
The Python code for the thermal model is located within the team's GitHub repository at the following path:
https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2025-ideabatic-3DPrint/blob/64eca1a5af41744abf37b80db37fa1698ad59f40/Hussain-Thermal-Model-Kitty.ipynb

The code is written in Python and primarily utilises the numpy library for numerical operations, such as logarithmic calculations. Whilst matplotlib is imported, it is currently reserved for potential future visualisation within the notebook itself, not for calculations.

The core logic of the model is encapsulated within the calculate_cooler_performance function. This function takes a comprehensive set of design and environmental parameters as input, enabling flexible simulation of various cooler configurations. Its output is a dictionary providing key performance metrics, including the total_heat_loss_W, cooling_duration_hours, the total_outer_diameter_cm (which is a critical design dimension), and crucial boundary temperatures (temp_at_insulation_edge_degC, temp_at_air_edge_degC) for safety analysis.

An example of how to invoke the function and interpret its results is provided in the if __name__ == "__main__": block within the Jupyter notebook itself. This allows for straightforward testing and verification of design changes.

4. Design Background and Iteration
Our initial baseline cooler design (as described in Section 2) was developed to provide a substantial vaccine capacity. However, a significant shift in design strategy occurred, driven by the project's evolving needs, particularly the aspiration for drone delivery. This necessitated a drastic reduction in size and weight.

The main characteristics that were changed were the overall size and shape of the cooler. This had direct effects on the dimensions of the insulation thicknesses, as well as the radius and length of the ice container itself. These changes, in turn, profoundly affected the cooler's thermal performance – specifically, how long the vaccines would remain cool and how long the ice would take to melt.

A key decision in this iteration was to fix the size of the ice bottle (the inner core of the cooler) and build all subsequent insulation and casing layers around it, rather than designing the outer shell first. This strategic decision led to a smaller cooler overall, which, as a trade-off, resulted in the ice lasting for less time and the total number of vaccine doses transportable being reduced from approximately 540 doses to roughly 270 doses.

Therefore, for the shrunk design, the ice bottle's length and radius became fixed parameters:

New Length of cylindrical container (L 
container
​
 ): 0.155 m

New Radius of inner ice container (r 
ice
​
 ): 0.045 m

New Mass of ice (m 
ice
​
 ): 1 kg (this is consistent with the shrunk size).

With these new fixed inner dimensions, the objective for this smaller shape was to maximise the cooling time so that vaccines could be kept cold for delivery via drones. This required iterating on everything else around this fixed inner core. The parameters varied during optimisation included the thicknesses of the insulation layers:

t 
insulation, inner
​
  (thickness of inner insulation)

t_{\text{air_gap}} (thickness of air gap)

t 
foam, outer
​
  (thickness of outer foam)

t_{\text{flat, insulation, top_bottom}} (thickness of flat inner insulation)

t_{\text{flat, foam, top_bottom}} (thickness of flat outer foam)

The thermal conductivities (k values) of the materials and the convection coefficients (h values) were kept constant during this optimisation phase, focusing on optimising the physical dimensions of the insulation layers.

5. Experimental Setup (for Virtual Simulations) and Results
The calculate_cooler_performance function was utilised to perform a series of virtual experiments (simulations) to explore the design space around the fixed inner dimensions of the smaller cooler (L 
container
​
 =0.155 m, r 
ice
​
 =0.045 m, 1 kg ice).

The process involved systematically varying the insulation layer thicknesses and observing their impact on cooling duration and total heat loss. This allowed us to understand the trade-offs between insulation effectiveness and overall cooler size. Whilst specific increments for iteration were managed by other team members, the variations would have been within ranges achievable by 3D printing. Typical tolerances for FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) 3D printing, for example, can range from ±0.1 mm to ±0.5 mm depending on the printer, material, and geometry, which would have guided the practical step sizes for the thicknesses explored.

A significant observation from these simulations was that the smaller size of the cooler, when optimised with appropriate insulation, achieved a solid cooling life much greater than what we initially require for drone delivery, which is a minimum of 24 hours. This indicates a robust thermal performance for the designed cooler.

Diminishing Returns Analysis ("Python Profile"):
To further understand the efficiency of adding insulation, a dedicated "python profile" analysis was conducted using a separate script. This analysis specifically allows for inputting any given ice container radius and length, and it will then identify the point where adding more insulation leads to diminishing returns in cooling performance. This is achieved by systematically varying an insulation thickness (in the provided profile, t 
insulation
​
  from 0.001 metres (1mm) to 0.1 metres (10cm)) and calculating the marginal gain in cooling time.

The primary conclusion derived from this "python profile" is its utility as a future design tool. It allows subsequent teams or Ideabatic to quickly calculate the optimal insulation thickness required if they design coolers with different internal dimensions (e.g., to accommodate larger payloads for more advanced drones). It enables them to find the "sweet spot" where insulation is sufficient without incurring unnecessary material cost, weight, or outer dimensions for negligible thermal benefit. For instance, the profile would help determine that beyond a certain thickness of foam, the gain in cooling time becomes insignificant relative to the increase in cooler size and material cost, thus defining an optimal range for foam thickness.

Optimal Design Parameters and Performance:
Based on the optimisation process, the "current design" (the optimal smaller shape) achieved the following performance:

Cooling Duration: 85 hours

Total Outer Diameter: 31.8 cm

To achieve this performance with the fixed inner dimensions (L 
container
​
 =0.155 m, r 
ice
​
 =0.045 m, m 
ice
​
 =1 kg), the final chosen insulation thicknesses were:

t 
insulation, inner
​
 : 0.004 m (Based on code snapshot)

t_{\text{air_gap}}: 0.03 m (Based on code snapshot)

t 
foam, outer
​
 : 0.08 m (Derived from total diameter and other fixed dimensions)

t_{\text{flat, insulation, top_bottom}}: 0.004 m (Assumed same as t 
insulation, inner
​
 )

t_{\text{flat, foam, top_bottom}}: 0.05 m (Based on code snapshot for flat layers)

This significantly exceeds the minimum 24-hour requirement, providing a substantial safety margin for drone delivery operations.

6. Instructions on Manufacturing and Assembly (Informed by Model)
Whilst the direct manufacturing and assembly processes for the physical cooler are primarily handled by the CAD group, my thermal modelling work provides the critical quantitative specifications that directly inform their design and production.

The thermal model's output, particularly the identified "optimal" dimensions (such as the specific thicknesses for the inner insulation, air gap, and outer foam, along with the resulting overall cooler diameter), serve as the foundational "blueprints" for thermal performance. For instance, the model dictates:

The precise length (0.155 m) and radius (0.045 m) for the central ice bottle (which was fixed in our current iteration).

The required thicknesses of each insulation layer (e.g., 0.004 m for inner insulation, 0.03 m for air gap, 0.08 m for outer foam) to achieve the target cooling duration.

The necessary thermal conductivity values (k) for the materials to be sourced (e.g., 0.03 W/mK for foam and inner insulation), ensuring they meet the thermal performance requirements.

Essentially, the model's role is to ensure that the physical dimensions and material choices made during CAD and manufacturing will result in the desired cold chain performance. As long as the components are produced to these specified dimensions (accounting for manufacturing tolerances, e.g., typical 3D printing tolerances of ±0.1 mm to ±0.5 mm) and use materials with the specified thermal properties, the cooler is predicted to perform as intended.

7. Suggestions for Improvement (If more time)
For Ideabatic (Immediate/Near-Term Improvements):

Cost-Benefit Analysis Integration: Integrate a basic cost model into the simulation to allow for optimisation based on cooling_duration_hours per unit cost or per unit volume. This would provide Ideabatic with direct insights into the most economically viable designs.

Material Library Expansion: Develop a more comprehensive, externally accessible database of common insulation materials relevant to their supply chain, including their thermal conductivities, densities, and approximate costs. This would simplify material selection for future designs.

User-Friendly Interface: Consider developing a simplified front-end (e.g., a simple web tool or a more interactive Jupyter dashboard) for the thermal model. This would enable non-technical users at Ideabatic to easily input design parameters and quickly evaluate performance without needing deep knowledge of the underlying code.

For Future Students (Longer-Term Research/Development):

Radiation Heat Transfer: Incorporate a robust model for radiation heat transfer, particularly important for coolers exposed to direct sunlight or warm surfaces, as this can be a significant heat gain mechanism.

Transient Thermal Analysis: Extend the current steady-state model to a transient analysis. This would allow for simulating the cooler's internal temperature profile over time as the ice melts, providing more granular data on how long specific vaccine temperature ranges are maintained, not just until all ice is gone.

Advanced Convection Modelling: Investigate and implement more sophisticated empirical correlations for natural and forced convection, especially for complex geometries or varying external air flow conditions.

Multi-Objective Optimisation: Explore advanced optimisation algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms or those available in scipy.optimize) to simultaneously optimise for multiple, often conflicting, objectives such as maximising cooling duration, minimising overall size/weight, and minimising material cost.

Physical Validation: A critical next step would be to design and conduct controlled physical experiments on prototype coolers to rigorously validate the model's predictions. This would involve measuring heat flux and temperature profiles under various conditions to fine-tune and improve the model's accuracy.

Phase Change Material (PCM) Integration: Extend the model to simulate the use of different Phase Change Materials (PCMs) beyond ice. This could allow for maintaining different temperature ranges (e.g., 4 
∘
 C without freezing) or achieving longer durations, potentially simplifying logistics.

Vibration and Structural Analysis: Whilst rubber tips mitigate vibration, a future model could explore the thermal implications of repeated mechanical stresses on insulation or the effectiveness of vibration dampening materials.
